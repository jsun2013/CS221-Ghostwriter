This is dependent on the directory structure as given in the zip archive. So, this archive contains a copy of everything in the data archive.

main.py contains all of the high level commands. Running it once should suffice to set everything up.


Separately, without running main.py, you can run the following commands:
    from poemClassification import *
    from gen2 import *
    authorVectors, testVectors, trainingSet, testingSet = styleTrainer() # Grabs the statistics
    authorWeights = getWeights(authorVectors,trainingSet,testingSet) # Trains the weight vector
    
Now you should be able to run the classifier and the generator

To run the generator, run the following commands:
    gen = generator()
    gen.add_authors(authorVectors)
    poem = gen.generate_poem(|author|, |print_flag|) # This will return the string of the poem.
                                                     # |author| is one of the five author choices:
                                                     #      'Kerouac'
                                                     #      'Seuss'
                                                     #      'Frost'
                                                     #      'Dante'
                                                     #      'Coleridge'
                                                     # if |print_flag| is True, this will also print out the poem to stdout
 
 To run the classifier:
    poet_classification = classifyPoem(authorWeights,|poem|) # authorWeights is initialized above, either by running main.py, or by running the command separately
                                                             # |poem| is a string contatining the poem. 
 
 To run the classifier on a poem generated by the generator:
    poem = gen.generate_poem(|author|, |print_flag|)
    poet_classification = classifyPoem(authorWeights,poem)
