THE FISHERMAN’S swapping a yarn for a yarn	
Under the hand of the village barber,	
And here in the angle of house and barn	
His deep-sea dory has found a harbor.	
 
At anchor she rides the sunny sod	        
As full to the gunnel with flowers a-growing	
As ever she turned her home with cod	
From George’s Bank when winds were blowing.	
 
And I know from that Elysian freight	
She will brave but once more the Atlantic weather,	        
When dory and fisherman sail by fate	
To seek for the Happy Isles together.
